# Advanced-Digital-Envelope-System
Advanced Digital Envelope System Using Cryptography Encryption Techniques 
The digital envelope system is the technique which is used to protect the message through encryption.<br>
It uses two types of encryption scheme to secure a message.

-  First, the message itself is encoded using symmetric encryption and then the session key is also encrypted using public-key encryption.
-  But the original digital envelope system cannot provide the features of the data authentication and data integrity.
-  By using a hash algorithm, these features can be obtained.
-  This is the demonstration of the advanced digital envelope system by using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) as symmetric algorithm, RSA as asymmetric algorithm and SHA-256 as hash algorithm.
-  This system is developed by using Python3.<br>
This Application helps you to encrypt and decrypt the envelope which is a text file with better grapgical user interface.<br>
### NOTE: Use the same keys to decrypt the envelope which are generated while encypting the envelope.
